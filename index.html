            <p>Just had an amazing first ever try dive with George at Poseidon Diving Centre. He was very clear at
                explaining things, reassuring and attentive throughout, and very safety aware. <br> <br>

                I was nervous but George
                helped me relax. My partner did a scuba dive in a more experienced dive spot with George and had a
                wonderful time too. The dive spots were stunning and boat ride was really fun! <br><br>

                Thoroughly recommend
                George and the diving centre!</p>

                and Georges was here for the security. It was really <br> <br>

                The explanations were good with some exercices even before the dive to help the beginners to be

            <p>We did a dive with George in June 2022 and it was great. Our last dives had been a while, so we wanted to
                do a refresher, just to feel safe about the various routines.
                George was great. He picked us up from our hotel and on the way to his base he talked us through our
                options. He did the refresher with us, in the shallow waters of the bay, just down from his shop and
                afterwards we did a dive by Limni Beach in a small group of six, all up. We felt really safe and cared
                for as he lead the dive, always checking back whether we all were OK. On the way back to our hotel we
                chatted a bit about his jobs as a Saturation Diver, and man, I'm sure you can't find anyone who you can
                feel safer with.</p>
